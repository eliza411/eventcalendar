  In order to learn about Drupal
  As a site builder
  I need to install Drupal

    Given an empty database called "mydb"
    And a clean settings file
    And I am on "install.php"
    When I check "Standard"

    And I press "Save and continue" 
    And I fill in the following:
    | Database name     | mydb |

    And I press "Save and continue"
    And wait "10" seconds
    And I fill in the following:
